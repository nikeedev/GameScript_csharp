# GameScript

**This is a cool project for doing cool printing( like `Console.WriteLine(); / Console.Write(); `), which in this case you can run without editing and you will see a star in the middle of the screen, which can be changed position and player icon later in `Program.cs`.**


**Ask anything in issues, or if you got any ideas or bugs about it!**

----------------------

### Requirements

**`.NET Core` installed, `.NET 6` installed( you can change `gameScript.csproj`, because really, game engine works on any version( as long it successed the build and doesnt get errors )), and a PC running it comfortelly for you!**
